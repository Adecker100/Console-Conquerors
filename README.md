To play Console Conquerors! you must first download all files and then run the .exe in the same folder with all of the other files.
Console Conquerors! can only be played on Windows and only Windows 10 / 11 have been tested.
If you are on Windows 11, please enter the console settings and make sure you are running the "Windows Console Host" rather than the default "Windows Terminal."
